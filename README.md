## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties/vars
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced the mix-blend-mode, which was required on the orange overlay on one of the images, however it mixed with the colours of the image.

I also used &nsbp for the first time in html which is non breaking space to create extra space between letters in the footer text.
